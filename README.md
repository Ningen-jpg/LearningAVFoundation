# LearningAVFoundation
This project serves me to learn how to use the camera features of AVFoundation

I deconstructed iOS's camera app to be able to learn how to implement its features myself.

I recreated the following features: 
- Taking pictures
- Taking videos


Inside this repository there is also my own keynote for the presentation with more details about the learning process
